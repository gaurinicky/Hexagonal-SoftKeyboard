#Hexagonal-Softkeyboard
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT
As touchscreen devices become readily available to the users, different input methods are required to improve text entry speed by improving either the keyboard arrangement, key shape, or both. Using hexagonally shaped keys there is a higher improvement rate in text entry because users are less prone to make errors while inputting text. Participants also indicated that using the hexagonal keys they were able to increase their typing efficiency without requiring to edit their input frequently, whereas for keyboard layout the users are all accustomed to the standard QWERTY keyboard and find it difficult to immediately adapt to a new keyboard arrangement.
